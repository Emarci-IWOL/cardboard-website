    <p>This page holds my video work from this block. It's an unconventional compilation of many sessions spent working on my sculptural piece for the installation. Originally, I planned to have this as the major focus of my work. However, over the weeks it became clear that video work would take top billing, and ultimately I could discard the actual sculpture.</p>
